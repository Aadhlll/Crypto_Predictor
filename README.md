# Crypto_Predictor
## Sentiment Analysis and Prediction of Cryptocurrency Prices Using LSTM
### Overview
In this project, I aim to build a predictive model for cryptocurrency prices by incorporating sentiment analysis of crypto-related news. The model leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to analyze sequential data and forecast future price movements. This approach integrates financial data with sentiment analysis to enhance the accuracy of predictions.

### Data Collection
The data for this project is collected through web scraping using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The following data sources are included:

News Headlines: Crypto-related news articles and headlines are scraped from various financial and cryptocurrency news websites. This data is essential for sentiment analysis, which helps gauge the market sentiment and its potential impact on cryptocurrency prices.
Cryptocurrency Prices: Historical and real-time price data of various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, are gathered from reputable crypto exchanges and financial platforms.
International Currency Rates: Exchange rates of major international currencies are collected to understand the broader financial context and its influence on the cryptocurrency market.
### Methodology
Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is performed on the collected news headlines to determine the overall market sentiment. The steps involved are:

Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the news headlines to remove noise and prepare the text for analysis.
Sentiment Scoring: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and pre-trained sentiment analysis models to assign sentiment scores from range -1 to 1 (positive, negative, or neutral) to each headline.
Predictive Modeling
The core of the predictive modeling process involves using an LSTM network to analyze the sequential nature of cryptocurrency prices and their relationship with market sentiment. The steps involved are:

Data Preprocessing: Preparing the time-series data of cryptocurrency prices and sentiment scores for input into the LSTM model.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features from the collected data, including price history, sentiment scores, and international currency rates.
Model Training: Training the LSTM model on the prepared dataset to learn patterns and relationships between the features and future cryptocurrency prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
### Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM implementation), NLTK/Spacy (for NLP and sentiment analysis), Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing and model evaluation)
Web Scraping: Selenium, BeautifulSoup
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of combining sentiment analysis with advanced predictive modeling techniques to forecast cryptocurrency prices. By leveraging the power of LSTM networks and incorporating market sentiment, the model aims to provide more accurate predictions, aiding traders and investors in making informed decisions.
